# Overview

I coded a calculator in JavaScript using an HTML front end with CSS as my styling

The purpose of this was to get a better understanding of the JavaScript language as well as how it works with a front end like HTML and CSS.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio code as my integrated development environment. I add some additional plugins that help me one was live share in order to host a live version of my HTML website to test my code and see if it worked. As well as I used Chrome and it's inspect feature in order to get a better understanding of how my code was working behind the scenes.

I just used JavaScript there was no libraries in this. Other than HTML and CSS those are the only other languages associated with this calculator project.
